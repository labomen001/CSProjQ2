           <p>Depression is a pretty persistent problem with today’s society. It influences people to do irrational things such as suicide for example. The minds of these people are full of negativity, hate, and of course, sadness. This results in the decrease of morale and productivity not just for the person but for the entire group. A person with depression should not be slacking off on his duties just because he can’t get over something and is a little sad. People are an important part of society of course. So, I would like to propose an idea to people with depression.
		   </p>
		   <p>Since way back, depression has already been part of humanity. However, instead of a decreasing rate over time, it seems to be increasing. According to a recent news article, depression rates in America increased by nearly three times since the pandemic began (Chatterjee, 2020). “A nearly 60% jump in suicides by young Americans since 2007 and Suicides among children and young people aged 10 to 24 rose 57% from 2007 to 2018, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” (Reinberg, 2020). I honestly can’t even imagine what life could’ve been now if those people were more productive with their lives. I mean, they must clearly know that the world doesn’t just revolve around them, right?
		   </p>
		   <p> I’ve observed that most people with this “Sad Disease”, tend to stray away from social interactions. I’m not entirely sure of the reason why since I myself do not have the courage and ability to speak to others. I’ve been spending most of my time alone in my room for the past nine months, isolated from others. This gives me the time and space to think of a way to completely eradicate this mind plot. Anyway, since they tend to stray. Someone could maybe hold a conference or a place to hold people with depression. This way, those with depression can’t think to themselves and they would be forced to socialize. 
		   </p>
		   <p>I assume this would be the case since being isolated would cause the isolated person to speak more about himself. As a way to leave a trace of the person’s existence, maybe? Or maybe it’s a way to feel needed or appreciated? I’m not entirely sure myself. I’ve been very indecisive lately and I’ve been having a hard time to find what I want to do. If this “conference” does not completely eradicate this mind disease, then I think the best method would be the easiest one. They should all just commit suicide. Of course, the realistic solution would be to get help from a psychiatrist or someone with a degree in psychology. Therapy would help those that aren’t completely lost to improve and maybe even recover completely. However, therapy has existed for quite some time now and as the data suggests, the suicide and depression rates don’t seem to have decreased. If they kill themselves, then they wouldn’t come in contact to normal people. This would result in the ideology to stagnate and die. It would also reduce the population which would result in more food for happier families. These happy families would then birth children who will live their lives without sadness. Only the strong would survive. Society does not need weak people who can’t even think for themselves properly. Seriously, if depression was a mental disease, then why not just erase the thought from your mind? It truly irritates me when people I know say they suffer from depression. If you can’t think of a way to save yourself, then go ahead. Your stupidity and lack of common sense is not needed here. I am sick and tired of it all. You have no worth in this world and truthfully so do I. It’s not just you.
		   </p>
		   <p>If you can’t make yourself useful to everyone then what even is your point in existing? Having the suicidal people commit suicide would not only reduce, if not completely eradicate depression. It would also lead to a surplus in supplies for the others. The death of these people would definitely lessen our workforce but I’d say it’s a small price to pay to a bright future wherein sadness is just a thing in the past. The children of the future would live their lives in happiness. You can’t really call me a murderer for enticing people to kill themselves. I am just giving them what they want. A statue of me may even be erected as a sign of gratitude for this genius proposal. The moment I get appreciated, I may even find a reason to live in this dark and horrid world. I truly hate it here. Sometimes I kind of even wish I was dead instead. My whole existence is nothing but a nuisance. Although I’ve been hopeless, I sincerely hope that this proposal may lead to the prosperity of the future.
